# Built-in Tools

## File Tools

### file_read
Read a file's contents. Always read a file before editing it — you need to see the current content to construct an accurate edit.

### write_file
Write content to a file (creates parent directories automatically). Use for creating new files. For modifying existing files, prefer `edit_file` instead.

### edit_file
Replace a specific text block in an existing file. Provide the exact `old_text` to match — it must appear exactly once. Include enough surrounding context to make the match unique. Always `file_read` the file first.

### list_dir
List directory contents. Use to explore project structure or check what files exist before acting.

## Shell

### exec
Execute a shell command. Returns stdout, stderr, and exit code.
- Has a timeout (commands that run too long are killed).
- Destructive commands (rm -rf, format, dd, etc.) are blocked by safety guards.
- Provide `working_dir` when the command must run in a specific directory.
- For long-running processes, warn the user about potential timeout.

## Background Execution

For tasks that take more than a few seconds — image generation, data processing, long scripts, batch operations. Do NOT use these for quick commands; use `exec` instead.

### exec_bg
Launch a shell command in the background. Returns a `job_id` immediately. The system notifies you automatically when the job finishes — no need to poll or check manually in most cases.
- Use `label` to give the job a human-readable name.
- `working_dir` sets where the command runs.
- Same safety guards as `exec`.

### output
Read the current stdout/stderr of a running or completed background job. Pass `job_id` and optionally `lines` (default 20). Use when you need to check progress mid-run.

### poll
Schedule a status check for all background jobs after N seconds. Use ONLY when the task produces periodic progress output you need to monitor (build logs, training progress, incremental results). In most cases you don't need this — the automatic completion notification is enough.

### kill
Terminate a running background job or cancel a scheduled poll. Pass the `job_id`.

### dismiss
Remove a completed/errored/killed job from the status summary. Cannot dismiss running jobs.

## Web Tools

### web_search
Search the web using the configured search engine (Brave Search or DuckDuckGo). Returns titles, URLs, and snippets. Use when the user asks a question that needs current information, or when you need to look something up.

### web_fetch
Fetch a URL and extract its content as markdown or plain text. Use when you have a specific URL to read (from search results, user-provided links, documentation). Set `extractMode` to "text" for simpler output or "markdown" (default) for structured content.

## Message

### message
Send a message to a specific channel and chat. In normal conversation, you do NOT need this tool — just respond with text directly. Use `message` only when:
- You need to send an intermediate status update during a multi-step tool operation
- You need to deliver a message to a different channel or chat than the current one

## Subagents

### spawn
Spawn a background subagent to handle a task independently. Good for:
- Tasks that take many steps and can run without user interaction
- Research or data-gathering that would take multiple tool calls
- Work that doesn't need back-and-forth with the user

The subagent gets its own tool access and reports back when done. Give it a clear, self-contained task description.

## Scheduling

### cron
Schedule and manage tasks. Actions:
- `add` — create a job. Requires `message` and one of `at`, `every_seconds`, or `cron_expr`. Optional: `name`, `mode`.
- `list` — show all scheduled jobs with mode, schedule, and status.
- `update` — modify a job. Requires `job_id`. Supports: `name`, `message`, `mode`, `enabled`, `every_seconds`, `cron_expr`.
- `remove` — delete a job by `job_id`.

**Schedule types:**
- `at` — ISO datetime (e.g. `"2026-02-12T15:00:00"`). One-shot: runs once and **auto-deletes**. Logs persist.
- `every_seconds` — interval in seconds (recurring).
- `cron_expr` — cron expression like `"0 9 * * *"` (recurring). Uses the user's local timezone automatically.

**Execution modes** (`mode` parameter):

| | Isolated (default) | Session |
|---|---|---|
| Context | Fresh — no session history | Full conversation history |
| Output | Must call `deliver_result` | Responds naturally in chat |
| Interaction | None — one turn, no questions | Fully interactive |
| Concurrency | Parallel — multiple jobs run simultaneously | Sequential — queued into session |
| Best for | Data fetching, reports, monitoring, automated checks | Reminders, conversation-aware tasks, follow-ups |

**Choosing a mode:**
- Default to `isolated` for any task that fetches data, runs commands, or produces a report.
- Use `session` when the task is a reminder, needs conversation context, or should feel like a natural message in the chat.
- When in doubt and the user hasn't specified, use `isolated`.

### deliver_result
Capture the final output of an isolated cron job. Only available during isolated cron execution. This is the ONLY way the user sees the result — if the agent doesn't call `deliver_result`, the job runs silently with no output delivered.

### Time expression reference

| User says | Parameters |
|---|---|
| at 3pm today | `at="2026-02-12T15:00:00"` |
| in 2 hours | `at` with computed ISO datetime |
| every 20 minutes | `every_seconds=1200` |
| every hour | `every_seconds=3600` |
| every day at 8am | `cron_expr="0 8 * * *"` |
| weekdays at 5pm | `cron_expr="0 17 * * 1-5"` |
| every Sunday at noon | `cron_expr="0 12 * * 0"` |

### Cron logs

Execution history is stored at `~/.ragnarbot/cron/logs/{{job_id}}.jsonl`. Each entry contains timestamp, status, duration, input, and output. Logs persist even after one-shot jobs auto-delete. Use `file_read` to inspect them.

## Configuration

### config
View and modify bot configuration at runtime. Actions:
- `schema` — discover available config fields with types, defaults, and reload levels. Pass `path` to filter by prefix (e.g. `agents.defaults`).
- `get` — read the current value of a config field. Requires `path`.
- `set` — change a config value. Requires `path` and `value`. Values are auto-coerced to the target type (e.g. "0.5" becomes float).
- `list` — show all current config values as a flat list.
- `diff` — show only values that differ from defaults.

Fields have reload levels:
- **hot** — applied immediately (e.g. temperature, max_tokens, stream_steps, search settings).
- **warm** — saved to disk, requires `restart` tool to apply (e.g. model, telegram settings, gateway port).
- **cold** — saved to disk, requires full re-onboard to apply (e.g. workspace path).

### restart
Schedule a graceful gateway restart. The restart happens after the current response is fully sent. Use after changing "warm" config values that need a restart to apply.

### update
Check for new ragnarbot versions, view release notes, and self-update. Actions:
- `check` — compare current version against the latest GitHub release. Returns `current_version`, `latest_version`, and `update_available`.
- `changelog` — fetch release notes for a specific version. Pass `version` (e.g. `"0.4.0"`) or omit to get the latest. Returns the release body from GitHub.
- `update` — upgrade ragnarbot to the latest version and restart. Tries `uv tool upgrade` first, falls back to `pip install --upgrade`. After upgrade, the gateway restarts automatically and sends a notification with the changelog URL.

## Downloads

### download_file
Download a file that the user shared in chat. When a user sends a document, voice message, or other file, you'll see a `[file available: ...]` marker with a `file_id`. Pass that `file_id` to this tool to download and access the file locally.
